# Hardware-Timer-Interrupts-on-TM4C123GH6PM
An embedded systems project demonstrating real-time LED blinking using timer interrupts on the TM4C123GH6PM (Tiva C). Includes configurations for 16-bit/32-bit timers, prescaler calculations, multi-timer control for different blink intervals, and an interactive version using switches to dynamically change blink speed and LED color.
